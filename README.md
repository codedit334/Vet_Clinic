## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

- How can I securely connect to and authenticate with the PostgreSQL database from my application or development environment, and what libraries or frameworks can I use to simplify this process?


    - To securely connect to a PostgreSQL database, you will need to provide the necessary connection details (such as the host, port, database name, and authentication credentials) in your application or development environment. You can typically use a library or driver specific to your programming language or framework to handle the connection and authentication process. Some common libraries for working with PostgreSQL in different languages include psycopg2 (Python), node-postgres (Node.js), and pg (Ruby). It's important to ensure that your application uses secure authentication methods (such as password authentication or SSL/TLS encryption) to protect sensitive data. You can also configure the PostgreSQL server to restrict access and limit privileges for different users or applications.
